## Advanced: Xero Integration Workflow

> **Note**: This is an optional advanced feature for users who need to log time in Xero accounting software.

If you need to automatically submit your logged tasks to Xero, this application provides a complete automation workflow:

### Prerequisites for Xero Integration

3. **Playwright** (for Xero automation):
   ```bash
   yarn add --dev @playwright/test
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Xero Integration Setup

1. **Create environment file**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_XERO_USERNAME=your-xero-email@example.com
   VITE_XERO_PASSWORD=your-xero-password
   VITE_XERO_CONTACT_NAME=Your Contact Name in Xero
   VITE_XERO_TEMPLATE_PATH=C:\Users\YourName\Downloads
   ```

2. **Run PowerShell setup** (Windows only):
   ```bash
   # Navigate to powershell-scripts folder
   # Right-click on setup.ps1 ‚Üí "Run with PowerShell"
   ```

   This creates two desktop shortcuts:
   - **Daybook App**: Opens the Vue.js application
   - **Xero Logger**: Runs the automation script

### Xero Automation Workflow

1. **Log tasks** in the Daybook application
2. **Export to CSV** using the export button
3. **Run Xero automation**:
   - Use the "Xero Logger" desktop shortcut, or
   - Run manually: `yarn test:e2e xeroWorkLogger.spec.ts`

The automation will:
- Open Xero in a browser
- Login with your credentials
- Navigate to time tracking
- Import and submit your CSV data
- Close automatically when complete

### Xero Integration Files

- `e2e/xeroWorkLogger.spec.ts` - Main automation script
- `powershell-scripts/` - Windows setup and utility scripts
- `templates/` - CSV templates for Xero import
